Primary steps:
First collect the pictures and store them in separate folders, which will be test, train, and validation folder. Imahges kept in each folder should be different from others.
After data collection, you will have to start data annotation, which will create the labels for the images inside the folder of train and validation folder, which in retun will save the co-ordinates of the object in the image.
then at first we will train the data, from the images and lebals training folder, and it will check its working on on the images of validation folder, and it will check if the images are detected as per the predicted value or not.
We will get the trained model and we will have to imply it in the test folder, to check if it detects correctly or not.
Congratulations, you have succesfully created your model.
